## âœ… Project 1: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

**Status:** Completed  
**Folder:** [Project 1: Pre-Trained Image Classifier for Dog Breeds](./project1-dog-breed-classifier)

### Overview
Developed a Python-based command-line tool that uses a pre-trained CNN to:
- Determine whether an image contains a dog, human, or neither
- If a dog (or human) is detected, identify the dog breed using a classifier architecture (AlexNet, VGG, or ResNet)

### Key Components
- `check_images.py`: CLI script to run the classifier and interpret results  
- Custom `classifier.py` module for transfer learning  
- Directory and argument parsing using `argparse`  
- Data loading and model evaluation using PyTorch

## ðŸŽ¯ Project 2: Create Your Own Image Classifier

**Status:** âœ… Completed  
**Folder:** [Project 2: Image Classifier for 102 Flower Dataset](./project2-flower-classifier)

### Overview
Built a deep learning image classifier using PyTorch and transfer learning on the 102-category flower dataset.

### Key Components
- `train.py`: Trains a new model using a specified architecture (VGG16, etc.), with GPU support and checkpoint saving  
- `predict.py`: Loads a saved checkpoint and predicts the top K most likely flower categories from a given image  
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models and custom classifier heads  
- Utilized `argparse` for CLI input flexibility (e.g. hidden units, epochs, GPU toggle)  
- Final model achieves high accuracy on validation and test sets
