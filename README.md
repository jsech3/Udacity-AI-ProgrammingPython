## âœ… Project 1: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

**Status:** Completed
**Folder:** [Project 1: Pre-Trained Image Classifier for Dog Breeds](https://github.com/jsech3/Udacity-AI-ProgrammingPython/tree/main/Project%201%3A%20Pre-Trained%20Image%20Classifier%20for%20Dog%20Breeds)

**Overview:**
Developed a Python-based command-line tool that uses a pre-trained CNN to:

* Determine whether an image contains a dog, human, or neither
* If a dog (or human) is detected, identify the dog breed using a classifier architecture (AlexNet, VGG, or ResNet)

**Key Components:**

* `check_images.py`: CLI script to run the classifier and interpret results
* Custom `classifier.py` module for transfer learning
* Directory and argument parsing using argparse
* Data loading and model evaluation

## ðŸš§ Project 2: Create Your Own Image Classifier **\[IN PROGRESS]**

**Status:** In Progress

**Overview:**
Building a deep learning image classifier using PyTorch and transfer learning on the 102-flower dataset.
