Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three models classified Dog_01.jpg as "doberman, doberman pinscher".

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all models classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as "doberman, doberman pinscher".

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All models correctly classified Alligator_01.jpg as not a dog. For Sandwich_01.jpg: AlexNet correctly identified it as "french loaf" (not a dog), while ResNet and VGG misclassified it as "hotdog" (interpreted as a dog).

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: AlexNet performed best because it achieved 100% accuracy on not-a-dog classification, correctly identifying the sandwich as "french loaf" while ResNet and VGG misclassified it as "hotdog".
